## Why Does This Exist?

This tool makes it easy to send log lines to an OpenTelemetry collector, from anywhere. Any tool or process can now be the source for OpenTelemetry log lines.

No extra receivers, plugins or pipelines required - just native support for log line ingest - easily.

This tool also makes it easy to correlate log lines with OpenTelemetry traces. If you are interested in OpenTelemetry traces, check out [tracepusher](https://agardnerit.github.io/tracepusher/) - the equivalent to this tool - but for traces.
